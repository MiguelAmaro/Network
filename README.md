#This is a sample Window Web server and client

#Goals:
* Serve a legit static site(html,css, js)
* Serve webgl
* Accept and handle multiple connections
* Use multiple threads
* Provide a dashboard(html, ect.) for that runs on server host
* Use a small site generator for the dashboard
* Serve on the host machine(localhost:port#)
* Serve on LAN
* Port forward the server(yikes!) to access out side home network
* Use AWS EC2 instances as a host and serve from there.
